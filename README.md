# Petition
The idea behind this project is to create an online petition that visitors can sign, thanks to a canvas element on which users can draw their signature.
Once the data is saved, a cookie is set to remember this fact. Users get then redirected to another page that expresses gratitude for their support.
On subsequent visits to the site, people who have signed the petition will be redirected to this page. They don't have the opportunity to sign the petition again if they have the cookie indicating that they have already signed.
Petitioners can view edit or delete the signature and the personal information.
For the authentication part the password gets hashed with bcryp.
